* RE TheHive issue: https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/issues/956

## Todo etc..
* TheHive webhook (always running?) - see services
* TheHive functions in general
* TheHive: Device with URL & API
* TheHive: Conditions
* Generic object manipulation (maybe exists) functions
* MISP testing

## Goal
* Help analysts leveraging TheHive & MISP be able to automate processes without the need for writing code (This is hard :( ) 
* Automate wrapper creation for python libraries & swagger docs (this might take a while)
